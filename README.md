# flask-pytorch-object-recognition
A web application demonstrating object recognition on sequences of three images using a fine-tuned Faster R-CNN model in PyTorch.

This is a demonstrative application not meant to be distributed, however if you want to use it for your own use:
* Create a Python virtual environment and clone the project repository into it
* Run the "pip install -r requirements.txt" command within your virtual environment
* Replace all file paths in the source code with your own system's appropriate path
* Run the app.py script and open on the URL that is displayed in the terminal
